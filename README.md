# Python_GUI_darknet_yolov4
 GUI Application built using PyQt4. Multithreading to process multiple camera streams and using darknet yolov4 model for detecting people , to count the number of people that are violating the threshold distance.
 
 If Ipcameras have to be used instead of videofiles, replace Camera0,1,2 with the Ipcamera address.
 
 Ex: camera0 = 'rtsp://{}:{}@192.168.1.40:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0'
