# Python_GUI_darknet_yolov4
 Multithreading to process multiple camera streams and using darknet yolov4 model for detecting people ,count the number of people that are violating the threshold distance.
 
 If Ipcameras have to be used instead of videofiles, replace Camera0,1,2 with the Ipcamera address.
 
 Ex: camera0 = 'rtsp://{}:{}@192.168.1.40:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0'
